<div class="first" >
<p>In our daily life, people tend to link colors with everyday objects, emotion, sound or smell. </p>
    <p>For example, light yellow is mostly related to lemon; dark blue is related to sad feeling; pink is related to sweet smell.</p>
<p>This is explained by Synesthesia.</p>
    <p>Synesthesia is a perceptual phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway.</p>
